## Prompts for commands

When rich-click runs interactively, it collects all commands to be run and presents these to you, the user. You then need to choose whether to run all commands, choose some or to ignore all of them.

## Banned commands

As a very basic safety step, rich-click attempts to ignore any commands that start with the following: `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `sudo`. This is to avoid accidentally messing with your local system.

Please note that this is only for rough protection against accidents and would be easy for a malicious user to circumvent _(for example, putting these commands in a bash script and running that)_.
